same syntax as structures
difference in storage, in structures each memeber has its own storage location. In unions all members have same storage location, 
it can handle only one member at a time.

//creating a union name code
union item 
{
    int m;
    float x;
    char c;
    } code;

compiler allocates memory that can store the largest piece of memory, four bytes for a float variable in this case

code.m=379
code.x=7859.36
printf("%d",code.m)
//will give wrong result

unions can be initialized with type of the first value. For ex:
union item abc={10};//first member is int
union item abc={57.45};//error
