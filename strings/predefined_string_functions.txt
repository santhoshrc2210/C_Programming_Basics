The functions present in the string.h header are: (need to add functions that use pointers)


1.  strlen(s1) calculates the length of string s1. strlen doesn't count '\0' while calculating the length of a string.


2.  strcat(s1, s2) concatenates(joins) the second string s2 to the first string s1.


3.  strcpy(s1, s2) copies the second string s2 to the first string s1.


4.  strncpy(s1, s2, n) copies the first ‘n’ characters of the second string s2 to the first string s1. Need to manually terminate s1 by using escape character '\0'


5.  strcmp(s1, s2) compares two strings and finds out whether they are same or different. It compares the two strings character by character till there 
is a mismatch. If the two strings are identical, it returns a 0. If not, then it returns the difference between the ASCII values of the first non-matching 
pair of characters.


6.  strncmp(s1, s2, n) compares the first ‘n’ characters of s1 and s2.


7.
